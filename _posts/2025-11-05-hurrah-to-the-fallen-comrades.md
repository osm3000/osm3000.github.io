excerpt: To the real heroes of my life ... my friends

I've lived in 6 countries, on 3 continents, in 15 cities (where 'lived' means 6 months or more). Only once by choice; the rest were either chosen by my parents when I was young, or by necessity (studies or work) as I grew older.

I am originally from a place I no longer recognize; I feel closer to another place, but I don't really belong anywhere.

As I moved, I grew detached from places and cultures. I have vivid memories of that.

Except for people. I was very fortunate on many occasions with the people in my life. That is where I belonged.

But my story with people has been a mix of triumph and tragedy:
- They were my window to new ideas and feelings, and a source of warmth and coziness.
- And the source of some of my most painful scars.

The tree of life grew and diverged:
- There are those with whom I lost contact when I moved (before the digital era).
- And those with whom our relationship didn't thrive in the digital realm.
- Those whom I wronged.
- Those who wronged me.
- Those who, despite surviving so much, didn't survive the changes in context and experience, and with whom we are now stuck in the past and in nostalgia.
- Those I ended up hating, and with whom I ended my relationship.
- And those who ended up hating me, and who ended their relationship with me.
- Some passed away.
- Some were consumed by life tragedies.

Only a few relationships survived. The future doesn't look very different from the past.

To all my life comrades, those who are still around and the fallen many, I say: Hurrah to all of you! To all the times—the good and the bad. You made me who I am today. I am forever grateful.

Many of the sharp lines of my younger self (principles, right and wrong, etc.) are fading away and becoming meaningless.

It's not yet the [empire of dirt](https://youtu.be/8AHCfZTRGiI), but it's steadily getting there.

May we meet again in Valhalla, my dear friends, in simpler times, around a campfire, on the beachside in Barcelona, with music, dance, and laughter. No worries, no sorrows, no apologies, no tomorrow—just today.
