I've lived in 6 countries, 3 continents, 15 cities (lived = 6 months or more). Only once by choice, the rest were either chosen for my parents, or due to necessity (studies or work). 

On paper, I am originally from one place, on reality I am closer to a different place, but I don't fully belong to anywhere. 

I am detached from the feeling of belonging to a place or to a culture. I have vivid memories of what that looked like.

Except people. I was very fortunate in many occasions with the people in my life. That is where I belonged.

But my story of people has been a mix of triumph and tragedy: 
- They were my window to new ideas, feelings and a source of warmth and coziness. 
- And some of the most painful scars

The tree of life grew and diverged: 
- There are those whom I lost contact with once I moved (before the digital era)
- And those whom our relationship didn't thrive in digital realm
- Those whom I wronged
- Those who wronged me
- Those who, despite surviving everything, didn't survive changes in the context and experiences, and we are stuck in the past and the nostalgia moments
- Those whom I ended up hating so much, and I terminated my relationship with
- And those who ended up hating me so much, and terminated their relationship with me
- Some passed away
- Some ended up in tragedies that consumed their lives

Like Napoleon's campaign in Russia, the numbers were massive, but only few survived. The future doesn't look very different from the past.

To all my comrades, the few still around and the fallen many, I say: Hurrah to all of you! To all the times, the good and the bad. You made me who I am today. I am forever grateful.

May we meet again in Valhalla, in simpler times, around a camp fire, with music, dance and laughter. No worries, no tomorrow, just today.

Many of those sharp lines of my younger self (principles, right and wrong...etc) are fading away and becoming meaningless.
