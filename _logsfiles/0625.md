I've been working on Lazy Tetris for a while now. The core of it is implemented and stable now. The main issue is to finalize the project.

This is a quick recap:
1. I've tried to use `arcade Sections` to better manage the `View` (the main grid, the next shape...etc), but without success. For some reason, the view started to capture my keyboard strokes twice. I couldn't resolve this from the docs.
2. I managed to use [Nuitka](https://nuitka.net/) to build an executable on my Apple Silicon (dope!). 
   1. To target Windows: It seems easy to do [using `MinGW64` compiler](https://nuitka.net/user-documentation/user-manual.html).
   2. To target Linux: It requires a docker container. I think I should build a flow for this later, but I can't be bothered at the moment
3. I removed the initial menu and the leaderboard. It didn't feel right. I just wanted to play, and all these buttons were distracting me from what I want to do.
   4. I will just keep the top score, and add that to the status bar for reference

Update:
So, this is done for now. I've [released the code](https://github.com/osm3000/Lazy-Tetris) and made a very [silly video](https://github.com/osm3000/Lazy-Tetris) about it. 

For the ReadMe file in the repo, I tried for the first time to generate it using Github Copilot: I basically gave it the code as the context, with a short description for what the game does. The result was satisfying: I had to edit it afterwords, but it was nice all-in-all.

I am not sure yet how to properly communicate this kind of work, either on reddit or HN. At least with some friends they appreciated it.

Anyhow, here we are.

This morning I am experimenting with some physics on car racing game ([demo video here](https://youtu.be/2-mM0LrlAq8)). This is changing by the minute. 
What I will aim for is to build a track, and try to move the car as fast as possible in the track, without hitting the walls or the boundaries of the screen (penalty if you do).
The score will be based on speed and penalties.
