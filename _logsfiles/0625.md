I've been working on Lazy Tetris for a while now. The core of it is implemented and stable now. The main issue is to finalize the project.

This is a quick recap:
1. I've tried to use `arcade Sections` to better manage the `View` (the main grid, the next shape...etc), but without success. For some reason, the view started to capture my keyboard strokes twice. I couldn't resolve this from the docs.
2. I managed to use [Nuitka](https://nuitka.net/) to build an executable on my Apple Silicon (dope!). 
   1. To target Windows: It seems easy to do [using `MinGW64` compiler](https://nuitka.net/user-documentation/user-manual.html).
   2. To target Linux: It requires a docker container. I think I should build a flow for this later, but I can't be bothered at the moment
3. I removed the initial menu and the leaderboard. It didn't feel right. I just wanted to play, and all these buttons were distracting me from what I want to do.
   1. I will just keep the top score, and add that to the status bar for reference
